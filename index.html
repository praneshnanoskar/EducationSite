        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.
            A special Integrated Education for Disabled Children (IEDC) on hurts the poor disproportionately – by diverting funds intended for development, undermining a government's ability to provide basic services, feeding inequality and injustice, and discouraging foreign investment and aid" (Kofi Annan, in his statement on the adoption of the United Nations Convention against Corruption by the General Assembly, NY, November 2003).

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or preceptor after initiation.[28] The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between Guru and his Shishya (students /diciples) was very important part of the education.[29] Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher learning institute in India from possibly 8th century BCE, however, it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in Ariano</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is a Concurrent List subject, that is both the Indian central government, and the state governments have responsibility for enacting and implementing education policy.[35] The central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the "10+2" pattern of education.[36]: 3  In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in Junior colleges (Mumbai, Maharashtra),[36]: 44  and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's degree for college.[37] The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education, 6 years of High School followed by 2 years of Junior colleges.[36]: 5  This pattern originated from the recommendation of the Education Commission of 1964–66.[38] </p>
